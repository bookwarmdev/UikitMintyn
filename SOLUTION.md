File Structure:

If I had more time, I would have organized the files better by grouping related components, services, and styles into their own folders. This would make the code easier to manage and understand as the project grows. I’d also ensure that assets like images and styles are properly structured to keep everything neat.
UI Test Issue - Login Button Scrolling:

The issue with the login button not being visible on the screen would’ve been addressed by making sure the page automatically scrolls to the button when needed. I’d also make the page more responsive so that the button stays visible on all screen sizes, particularly on mobile, by adjusting the layout and using better viewport handling.
UI Design Enhancements:

With more time, I would’ve worked on improving the design—things like making buttons more visually appealing, adding animations for smoother interactions, and ensuring the layout works well on all devices. I would also focus on making the UI more accessible, like improving contrast, adding better keyboard navigation, and supporting screen readers.
